**Landmark-Based Business Discovery System for East Africa**
Project Background

Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in East Africa operate without formal street addressing systems. Instead of relying on street names and numbers, people commonly locate businesses using familiar landmarks such as petrol stations, markets, schools, malls, and bus stops.

While this approach works well locally, most global business discovery platforms depend heavily on formal addresses. As a result, these platforms are often ineffective at representing informal and small businesses in the region.

This project proposes a landmark-based business discovery system that enables users to find businesses using commonly known landmarks, thereby improving accessibility, visibility, and inclusivity for businesses operating in East Africa.

**Project Objectives**

**General Objective**
To design and implement a landmark-based business discovery system that allows users in East Africa to locate businesses using commonly known landmarks rather than formal street addresses.

**Specific Objectives**

To develop a system that allows businesses to register using nearby landmarks

To enable users to search for businesses using landmark-based queries

To centrally store and manage landmark information

To provide an administrative interface for validating businesses and landmarks

To improve the visibility of informal and small businesses within local communities

System Description

The landmark-based business discovery system is a web-based platform designed to support both formal and informal businesses. The system integrates mapping technology to visually display landmarks and nearby businesses.

Businesses can register by selecting a nearby landmark instead of providing a street address. Users can search for businesses by typing landmark names, viewing auto-suggestions, and exploring nearby business listings sorted by distance.
